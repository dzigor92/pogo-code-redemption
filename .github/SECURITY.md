# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The project is maintained on the `main` branch. Fixes for security issues are
released as patch updates on that branch. Older ZIP snapshots or forks are not
covered by this policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately so we have
time to evaluate and release a fix.

- Use GitHub's “Report a vulnerability” workflow by visiting the **Security →
  Advisories** tab and starting a draft advisory. This shares the details
  directly with `@dzigor92`.
- If the advisory form is unavailable, use the email address listed on the
  maintainer's GitHub profile to reach out directly.

We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and aim to provide an update
on remediation progress within 10 business days. Once a fix is available and
users have had a reasonable upgrade window, we will publish the advisory with
credit for the reporter (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
